## Project Context

**Project:** Beatsy - Home Assistant Custom Component for music year-guessing party game

**Project Classification:**
- **Type:** Software Application
- **Field Type:** Greenfield (new development)
- **Project Level:** 3-4 (Full BMM Method track with comprehensive planning)
- **Selected Track:** BMM Method - Greenfield path

**Completed Planning Phases:**
- Phase 0: Discovery (brainstorm-project, research) - Status unknown, proceeding
- Phase 1: Planning (PRD, UX Design) - ✅ Complete
- Phase 2: Solutioning (Architecture) - ✅ Complete
- Phase 3: Implementation Gate Check - ⏳ In Progress

**Assessment Scope:**
This readiness assessment validates the transition from Phase 2 (Solutioning) to Phase 4 (Implementation) by systematically checking:
1. Completeness of planning artifacts (PRD, Architecture, UX Design)
2. Coverage of requirements through epics and stories
3. Alignment and consistency across all artifacts
4. Identification of gaps, risks, or contradictions
5. Overall readiness to begin sprint-based development

**Expected Artifacts for Level 3-4 Project:**
- Product Requirements Document (PRD) with functional and non-functional requirements
- System Architecture document with decisions, patterns, and implementation guidance
- UX Design specification (for UI components)
- Epic breakdown with user stories and acceptance criteria
- Technical specifications integrated within architecture
